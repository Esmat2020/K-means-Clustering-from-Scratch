# K-means-Clustering-from-Scratch (UnSupervised learning Algorithm)
# Group data based on household power consumption 
# Problem definition :
- Consider the household power consumption data set in the file named Power_Consumption.csv, it contains the power consumption information of 200 households.
- group these households based on the similarity in their power consumption
- The final output of your program should show k lists of householdsâ€™ IDs, and show outlier records (if exists)
